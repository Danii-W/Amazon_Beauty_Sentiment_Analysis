### Interesting Findings


- The overall polarity plot revealed that most Amazon reviews in the beauty category exhibit a slight positive sentiment, and it highlights patterns and trends in sentiment.
- The time series analysis shows an overall increase in positive sentiment over the years, with notable spikes around 2012 to 2013, and dips indicating periods of customer dissatisfaction.
- The positive-sentiment word clouds featured words related to bath and dental products, while the negative-sentiment word clouds featured words related to product quality.
  - The word "waterpik" appears prominently in negative reviews in 2014, which is noteworthy given that "waterpik" was a positive term in 2007. This evident shift in sentiment towards the “waterpik” could reflect changes in product quality or consumer expectations over time.
- The user type word clouds, which create comparative word clouds from unverified or verified reviews, indicated that verified reviews showed more mixed sentiment, while unverified reviews showed a relatively positive sentiment.
  - It’s important to note that these unverified reviews with relatively positive sentiment may not be authentic or reliable, potentially inflating the product ratings.
